## Setting Up the Tools

While I had prior experience with **VSCode** and using **GitHub**, I encountered some challenges when trying to open my repositories with **WSL**.

### Installation Issue

I ran into an error while attempting to install the script:

```bash
scripts/venv.sh

# Activate virtual environment, observe prompt change after running it
source venv/bin/activate

``` 

To solve the issue, I had to properly install Python 3, as I was having some troubles with that. However, by following the steps given in the command output, the problem was fixed.

<style> body { font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; /* Change to a nice font */ } pre { background-color: #b3d9ff; /* Baby blue background */ padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; /* Font for code blocks */ font-size: 14px; overflow-x: auto; } </style>
